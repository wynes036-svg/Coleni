COLENI - SETUP COMMANDS
========================================

STEP 1: RESTART YOUR COMPUTER
(Git needs this to work after installation)

STEP 2: OPEN COMMAND PROMPT IN COLENI FOLDER
- Open File Explorer
- Go to: C:\Users\USER\Documents\coleni
- Click in the address bar and type: cmd
- Press Enter

STEP 3: RUN THESE COMMANDS ONE BY ONE
Copy and paste each line, press Enter after each one:

git init

git add .

git commit -m "Initial Coleni app"

STEP 4: CREATE GITHUB REPOSITORY
- Go to: https://github.com/new
- Repository name: coleni
- Keep it PUBLIC (important!)
- Click "Create repository"

STEP 5: GITHUB WILL SHOW YOU COMMANDS
Look for the section "...or push an existing repository from the command line"
It will show 3 commands that look like this (but with YOUR username):

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/coleni.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Copy those 3 commands from GitHub and paste them into your Command Prompt.

STEP 6: DEPLOY ON RENDER
- Go to: https://render.com
- Sign up with your GitHub account
- Click "New +" → "Web Service"
- Select your "coleni" repository
- Click "Create Web Service"
- Wait 3-5 minutes
- You'll get a link like: https://coleni-xxxx.onrender.com

DONE! Share your Coleni link with friends! 🎉

TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

If git still doesn't work after restart:
- Make sure you downloaded from: https://git-scm.com/download/win
- During installation, make sure "Git from the command line" was selected
- Try opening a NEW Command Prompt window

If you get "permission denied" on GitHub:
- You may need to set up authentication
- Easiest way: Use GitHub Desktop instead (https://desktop.github.com)
- Or follow: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication
